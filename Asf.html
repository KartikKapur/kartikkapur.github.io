            <h3>Assignment Solutions Finder</h3>
             <p> Assignment Solutions finder was the first outside of class project that I made while at
                        Berkeley. During this small scale hackathon, my team created an app that takes a input of
                        a PDF of section numbers a student needs to read, the problem numbers they need to respond to
                        and a PDF of the textbook. The app then outputs a PDF file that contains the required sections
                        to read, the required questions, and the answers.
                    <p>
                        In order to create this project, we had to first figure out how to read the input PDF. We did
                        this by going on a very extensive search for a tool that could be used to read PDFs- eventually
                        we
                        decided to use PDF tools. After this step, we had to figure out how to get the proper page
                        number
                        This was done by creating a python file whose purpose was to find the designated page range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A problem that we ran into while making this app was that there was a discrepancy between the
                        actual
                        assigned page number and the page number of the PDF (as the PDF had pages including the title).
                        To
                        account for this, we had to make a function that would calculate the offset. This was done by
                        reading
                        part of the PDF and then finding the book page number and subtracting it from the PDF page
                        number.
                        After these details were done, we were able to gather the section readings and the problems that
                        were required; however, we still had to work with Slader.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To solve this problem, we had to create a slader python file that would scrape
                        the Slader website in order to find the needed problems. Eventually, the output would give a PDF
                        of the problems and reading and the answers as provided by Slader.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        In this project, I learned a few skills including:
                        <li>Basics on how to scrape websites</li>
                        <li>How to work with PDFS</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
