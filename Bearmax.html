                    Bearmax is a Facebook chatbot that I helped create during CalHacks 3.0. Bearmax diagnoses users that
                    have minor ailments, essentially making it a smart WebMD.

                    <li>User feeds in a symptom</li>
                    <li>Bearmax confirms the symptoms</li>
                    <li>Bearmax asks if it has other related symptoms (yes or no buttons on the bottom)</li>
                    <li>Finally diagnoses with the percentage that you have the ailment, and then provides

            <h4>How does Bearmax work?</h4>
                       <p>
                In order to get Bearmax to work, we had to first had to create a Facebook app on
                the messenger platform. For our webhook, we had to
                create a heroku webserver and then use Flask as our web framework. Following this we created
                a Python file for the Watson
                Natural Language Processor to work. In order to keep track of the users,
                we used MongoDB- MongoDB allowed us to keep track of how many times users
                had messaged Bearmax, and also allowed us to keep track of the symptoms
                that had already been inputted. Our final outside source was APIMedic, an API
                service that has a list of many ailments and symptoms that are closely related
                to them.</p>

            <p>
                Following these basic steps, we had to make an actual "Bearmax" app
                We started by creating an init function that checked if it was the user's first time
                messaging the service- if this was the case, the user their age and their gender. Following
                this,
                the app would ask the user for a symptom that they currently have. </p>
            <p>
                After inputting one symptom,the user would be faced with a "yes or no" question that asked
                if they had
                a symptom that was closely related. The next symptom asked was found by using APIMedics
                data on closely related symptoms to the one that the user inputted. If the user responded
                "yes" to the question, we would find the symptom that is closest to the one the user said
                yes to
                (avoiding repeats). If the user said no, the first element was popped, and Bearmax would ask
                if they had the second most common symptom. This essentially created a "symptom" tree and
                allowed
                us to precisely estimate the symptom that the user had.</p>
            <p>
                Once the user had said "yes" to 5 symptoms, Bearmax would diagnose them, and give them
                a small description of the problem that they had and how they should treat it.
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned during this project</h3>
            <p>This project was my first at a "large scale" hackathon and I can say without a doubt
                that it was worth it. During this hackathon, I learned how to use:
            <li>Facebook Developers</li>
            <li>IBM's Watson (the Natural Language Processing aspect of it)</li>
            <li>MongoDB</li>

            This project is one of the ones that I am most proud of because I managed to throw myself
            into how programming can be utilized. I showed myself that I can program well and
            my team managed to win 2 prizes at one of the largest college hackathons as freshmen!
