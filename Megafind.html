            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <p>
                This project was really big, so I'll outline some of the main functionalities:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Portal:</b> Login for Professors. Professors could start and stop lectures
                </li>
                <li><b>Transcription :</b> Real time speech to text transcription of what the Professor is saying in
                    class that all students in the
                    class can view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Phrase Analysis:</b> Entity Analysis for the phrases before they are transcribed. Articles that
                    are relevant
                    are found and then the phrase becomes a hyperlink in the transcript
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Assisted Note taking:</b> Professors can pass in a google slides file and the text is written
                    onto
                    an edittable text file. This makes it so students do not have to rush to write the bullet points on
                    a slide
                    and can instead focus on clarifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The Digest:</b> At the end of each lecture session, a digest is composed of 3 main parts, a
                    summary of the transcription of the lecture, the notes that the student wrote in the notes tab, and
                    the important phrases along with a 2 sentence summary for each one. This makes it optimal for
                    studying
                    before a test or just review in general.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>How does Megafind work?</h4>

            <p>
                This project was fairly massive in terms of the amount of features it had and the time it was built in.
                To get the initial set up, we had to get an idea of what we wanted to do. We started set up by getting a
                hold
                of the Google Speech to Text API and a summarizer API from Intellexer. Following this, we created a few
                generalizations
                where the Google Speech to Text API should convert the given sentence into a question instead of a
                statement since
                that functionality was lacking. </p>
            <p>
                We then used the Google Natural Language API to create an Entity Extractor that would find relevant
                phrases in our text during the real time transcription process. Following this, we used the Google
                Search API to
                find a link for all the relevant phrases. The relevant phrases would then be turned into hyperlinks when
                being transcribed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the Slides API from Google, we were able to parse the provided powerpoint from teachers and write
                it into an edittable text tab.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create our digest that is sent to the students at the end of the lecture session, we gathered the
                following
                data:
            <ul>
                <li>A summary of the transcript</li>
                <li>Notes that the student wrote during the live lecture</li>
                <li>The key words and a short 2 sentence summary about them</li>
            </ul>
            We then wrote this data into a textfile and sent it. We gathered the summary by using the Intellexer API,
            the lecture
            notes were gathered from the notes file, and the key words were also go from storage; however, we had to use
            the
            Google search API to find 2 sentences about them. We stored the data about which students to email
            through Mlab and we actually sent the email by using the Sparkpost API
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned during this project</h3>
            <p>This project is the one that I am the most proud of, I learned how to use:
            <ul>
                <li>NodeJS: I had no experience with javascript before this. Also, my team had minimal expertise in the
                    language
                    so there was a steep learning curve for all of us.
                </li>
                <li>Google Cloud API</li>
                <li>Google Slides API</li>
                <li>Google Search API</li>
                <li>Sparkpost API API</li>
            </ul>
            My team worked so well together. Our strengths complemented each other and the dynamic between all of us
            allowed us to perform so well. We were driven to do the best that we could despite coming in not knowing
            about anything what were going to work on. This allowed us to remain motivated and really push ourselves to
            learn more.
